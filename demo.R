# Load the street segments that define the (main roads of the) road network of
# the Isle of Wight (an Island located in the south of England) according to a
# driving mode of transport
iow <- st_read("isle-of-wight.gpkg")

# Let's see a plot
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(iow)

# and an interactive plot
mapview(iow)

# We can already notice that there are several groups of segments that look
# disconnected from the main network.

# From LINESTRING(s) to sfnetwork object ----------------------------------

# Now we can convert the "raw data" into a sfnetwork object.
sfn <- as_sfnetwork(iow, directed = FALSE)

# and let's see the printing method
sfn

# We can notice that:
# 1. The output reports a short description of the sfnetwork object summarising,
# among the other things, the number of nodes and edges, the CRS, the number of
# components.
# 2. The sfnetwork class inherits the tbl_graph class (see ?tbl_graph) which
# means that we can apply all tidygraph and igraph methods to sfnetwork objects
# (we will see several examples later). Moreover, we can see that, by default,
# the nodes represent the active geometry (more details later on).
# 3. The connectivity among the road segments is summarised using two columns in
# the edge table named "from" and "to".

# Moreover:
# 1. The nodes of the sfnetwork object are created at the (unique) endpoints of
# the input lines. This has importance consequences (see below).
# 2. The argument `directed = FALSE` forces the construction of an undirected
# network. See the introductory vignette for examples on how to create an
# sfnetwork object mixing one-way and two-way roads.
# 3. The are several other ways to create an sfnetwork object. See ?sfnetwork
# and ?as_sfnetwork for more examples.
# 4. We can adjust the number of features printed for the active and inactive
# table using the options `sfn_max_print_active` and `sfn_max_print_inactive`.
# For example:
options(sfn_max_print_active = 2L, sfn_max_print_inactive = 1L)
sfn

# Warning: this is still an experimental feature existing only in the develop
# branch.

# Again, let's see a plot
plot(sfn)

# The sfnetwork method for the plot function is a wrapper around
# plot.sfc_GEOMETRY, which means that we can adjust several aspects.
plot(sfn, cex = 0.1, lwd = 0.05)

# There is also an autoplot method
autoplot(sfn)

# We will see more complex examples later on.

# Active and inactive geometries ------------------------------------------

# An sfnetwork object is a multitable object composed by two sf tables (one for
# the nodes and one for the edges). There is always one of the two tables which
# is labeled as "active". That table is the target for the data manipulation
# verbs.

# For example
options(sfn_max_print_active = 0L, sfn_max_print_inactive = 0L)
sfn

# You can switch the active table using the function "activate" or the shortcuts
# "%N>% and %E>% (just for pipe chains in interactive coding sessions)
activate(sfn, edges)

# Pre-processing steps ----------------------------------------------------

# As already mentioned, real-world spatial networks may require a bunch of
# pre-processing steps before we can apply sf or igraph algorithms. Hence, we
# implemented a collection of morphers (see below for more details) to process
# the input data:

sfn_clean <- sfn %E>%
  convert(to_spatial_subdivision) %>%
  arrange(edge_length()) %>%
  convert(to_spatial_simple) %>%
  convert(to_spatial_smooth) %>%
  convert(to_components, .clean = TRUE)

# Check the companion slides for several toy examples showing the importance of
# this morphers.

# Let's check the printing
sfn_clean

# and a plot
plot(sfn_clean)

# A few comments:
# 1. The spatial and graph morphers (i.e. to_spatial_subdivision,
# to_spatial_simple, to_spatial_smooth, and to_components) are used to create
# temporary alternate representation of the input network. On the other hand,
# the function convert is used to extract this temporary representation (or the
# first graph in case of multiple representations) and convert it into an
# sfnetwork object. See the fifth package vignette for more details and check
# `?convert`.
# 2. The "clean" version of the `sfn` network is much simpler than the original
# data since we extracted only the nodes and edges that belong to the first
# component of the network. We can clearly notice that from the printing and
# plot methods.

# Computing graph measures ------------------------------------------------

# We can use some dplyr verbs (which are loaded by tidygraph) to modify the
# edges and nodes tables. For example, the following code computes some simple
# graph measures (e.g. vertex degree) and adds them to the corresponding tables:
sfn_clean <- sfn_clean %N>%
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree())

# We can add a column in the edges table measuring the length of each LINESTRING
# object:
sfn_clean <- sfn_clean %E>%
  mutate(weight = as.numeric(edge_length()))

# and compute weighted graph measures:
sfn_clean <- sfn_clean %>%
  mutate(betw = centrality_edge_betweenness(weights = weight, directed = FALSE))

# Let's see a printing
options(sfn_max_print_active = 2L, sfn_max_print_inactive = 2L)
sfn_clean

# and some (more elaborate) plots:
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(sfn_clean, "edges"), col = "grey", size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(sfn_clean, "nodes"), aes(col = degree, size = degree)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1.5, 3)) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(), size = guide_legend()) +
  labs(col = "Node degree", size = "Node degree")

# or
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(sfn_clean, "edges"), aes(col = betw, fill = betw), size = 1.2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "sqrt") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "sqrt") +
  labs(col = "Edge centrality \nbetweenness", fill = "Edge centrality \nbetweenness")

# More comments:
# 1. A graph measure can only be calculated if the correct table is marked as
# active, i.e. the following code returns an error
sfn_clean %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(betw = centrality_edge_betweenness())
# 2. The tidygraph package implements hundreds of functions for computing graph
# measures. See https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html for
# more details.
# 2. Not all dplyr verbs can be directly applied to a sfnetwork since we cannot
# tamper with the relational data structure.
# 3. Some tidygraph functions require you to always specify the arguments
# "weights" and "directed" (which are not inferred from the sfnetwork).
# 4. The node and edges tables can be extracted using the function "st_as_sf"
# specifying the argument "nodes" or "edges". This is quite important for
# plotting routines. The same structure holds for st_as_sfc function. The
# coordinates of the active geom can be extracted with st_coordinates:

sfn_clean %N>% st_coordinates() %>% head()

# vs

sfn_clean %E>% st_coordinates() %>% head()
# 5. The estimation of graph measures is quite relevant for developing
# statistical models at the network level. We will include an example at the end
# of this presentation.

# Spatial filters (and other sf operations) -------------------------------

# A sfnetwork object is usually represented as two sf tables. Hence, we extended
# several function defined in the sf package defining a method for sfnetwork
# objects (which implies that those function can be directly applied to
# sfnetwork objects). For example, we can change the CRS of both tables:

sfn_clean <- st_transform(sfn_clean, 27700)

# This is quite relevant for all those packages (e.g. spatstat) that do not
# handle spherical coordinates.

# We can use st_filter to apply a geometry predicate (such as st_intersects,
# st_contains, st_is_within_distance, and so on). For example, we can compute a
# 5km circular buffer around the centroid of the network
sfn_centroid <- st_centroid(st_as_sfc(st_network_bbox(sfn_clean)))
sfn_buffer <- st_buffer(sfn_centroid, 5000)

# and filter only the nodes that intersect that buffer
sfn_small <- sfn_clean %N>% st_filter(sfn_buffer)

# Let's see a plot:
par(mar = c(2.5, 2.5, 1, 1))
plot(sfn_clean, graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
plot(sfn_buffer, add = TRUE, border = "orange", lwd = 3)
plot(sfn_small, add = TRUE, col = "red")

# More details:
# 1. The function st_network_bbox is used to compute the bounding box of edges'
# and nodes' bounding boxes (since they may be different).
# 2. The function st_filter is always applied to the active element of the
# sfnetwork object.
# 3. Please note that when nodes are removed, their incident edges are removed
# as well. However, when edges are removed, the nodes at their endpoints remain,
# even if they donâ€™t have any other incident edges. For example:

sfn_clean %E>% st_filter(sfn_buffer) %>% plot(lwd = 3)
plot(sfn_buffer, add = TRUE, border = "orange", lwd = 3)
